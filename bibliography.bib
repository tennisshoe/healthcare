@article{symonds2005,
Abstract = {The article looks at the role of U.S. state governors and legislatures in health care reform. Massachusetts representatives passed a bill that would achieve near-universal health coverage by imposing an individual mandate that directs all residents that cannot get work coverage or Medicaid to buy their own health insurance. Illinois passed a bill which will extend comprehensive coverage to all children under 18. The author questions whether states can achieve health care reform, including widespread coverage and lower costs, without a taxpayer backlash. Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney hopes the expanded coverage will help his bid as a presidential candidate.},
